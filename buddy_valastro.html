          <h2 class="bio"> Biography </h2>
          <p class="biography">
            Buddy Valastro was born on March 3, 1977, in Hoboken, New Jersey. In his family,
            his mom, Mary, his father Buddy Valastro Sr., and his four sisters, Grace, Mary,
            Maddalena, and Lisa, all had an impact on his choice to go into baking. He began
            working at his family business when he was just 11 years old keeping him out of
            trouble. Working alongside his father as a punishment at first became something
            Valastro never thought it would be. Learning several techniques from his father,
            techniques that had been passed down from generation to generation. After the
            passing of his father at age 17, he decided to become serious and take over the
            company to fulfill the role of the “Cake Boss”. Through hard work and struggles,
            it was three years after the death of his father that he really started to have
            a handle on the family business. Several years in the baking business Valastro
            went viral and was started in the show “Cake Boss” on TLC. Finally, after his years
            of being in the baking and tv industry, he decided to settle down and work for
            us as a Cake Decorator instructor helping the kids of our college become better
            bakers. Overall the years, Valastro still believes of all his accomplishments,
            his greatest was his family. His main goal here at CISC is to help kids who have
            a strong passion, put their dreams into action.</p>
